  <h2>Does Money Have Value?</h2>

      <p>
        I studied anthropology and archaeology in my undergrad. I believe the
        value of money is exactly what we make it. Based in our very early
        development as homo sapiens, humans need to feel that if they are giving
        something away, they are receiving something in return. The value of
        money is directly tied to this need to feel rewarded in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a surface level, money is valuable because we have developed a
        society in which we must use it to purchase goods. Money is essential
        because we need to exchange it for items that help us fulfill our basic
        needs. Shelter, food, and basic comforts cost money. These things also
        cost money to create. Therefore, there is a secondary need to pay those
        responsible for their creation. If our purchasing footprints were
        smaller, and we were able to buy the things we needed from local
        craftsmen and farmers, this money to labour equation would remain
        relatively simple. We would pay the person who made our food, shelter,
        or goods directly, based on the cost of the materials and labour. For
        example, we may pay a farmer for the cost of seeds, water, and his time
        spent in their field.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this becomes more complicated as we reintroduce human nature.
        We as humans place value on objects for a variety of reasons (rarity,
        for example), creating what we call <em>perceived</em> rarity. Modern
        day advertising and marketing tactics can target human nature, and make
        us desire things that are not truly valuable, but become “valuable” due
        to clever manipulation of our perception of rarity, productivity, or
        status. The financial value of an object rises if the perceived value
        rises. In summary, humans created a transactional system long ago that
        has persisted to this day in a variety of forms. However, due to more
        modern influences, our perception and understanding of value has
        changed, and so the value of money changes too. With higher value, comes
        a higher price tag.

  <h2>Are GMOs Good, Bad, or Neither?</h2>

        GMO food has been hotly contested for many years. Why would we
        genetically change our food, altering its natural state? The answer is
        not so simple. GMO crops can have extremely beneficial uses. For
        example, in countries with poor farming conditions, be it for long
        periods of drought or high populations of harmful insects, crops can be
        genetically modified to withstand those conditions. Likewise,
        genetically modified crops can have their nutritional value modified,
        and can give higher doses of vitamins and minerals to populations
        lacking a well rounded diet. When we compare this to more developed
        countries though, with the financial resources to give access to food
        that satisfies all of its population’s nutritional needs, we begin to
        see some questionable uses of genetic modification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing crops that are the “best” version of themselves, selectively
        bred for colour, size, or beauty, can lead to mono-crop culture. This is
        when a single crop, or single type of crop is exclusively grown in one
        area. This leaves the crop vulnerable to disease or pests that can
        target a specific strain of crop. This is typically done to ensure that
        a competitor has more appealing product to win out over the competition
        at the grocery store.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, GMO foods are often engineered to produce a much bigger crop,
        and allow better use of the already limited farmland that North American
        cities have to grow their local crops. If used responsibly, genetic
        modification of foods can have great benefit. It is up to the
        populations that choose to consume them to use their best judgement. If
        GMO food development was limited to scientists, researchers who could
        provide better agricultural opportunities to poverty stricken and
        food-poor countries, the question of if GMOs are more good than bad may
        be more easily answered.

  <h2>The View From 2100</h2>

      <p>
        My view of the world in 2100 is bleak. I believe climate change will
        have become a reality, and only the richer countries will have
        implemented safeguards for its citizens. I believe the amount of animals
        and insects on earth will have dramatically decreased, and we will be
        facing more extreme weather events, with hotter summers and shorter and
        warmer winters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our only hope for the future is to start electing individuals who care
        about environmental policies, and the state of the climate crisis as it
        stands. We must support companies that actively work to minimize their
        environmental impact, and individuals who create technology to minimize
        our collective impact on the environment. I believe the days of young
        generations fictionalizing a shiny, futuristic, flying-car 2100 is over.
        Generation Z has been nicknamed the “doomers” because of their
        incredibly bleak outlook on the world’s climate, and the hope of making
        a change. We’ve entered a time of consciousness about the environmental
        impact humans have, but have also become aware that large companies that
        we as individuals cannot control are the source of the biggest climate
        damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is large companies’ dependency on plastic, and disregard of
        environmental regulations that is doing a significant amount of damage
        to the climate. If we are to have any chance at a future that
        environmentally, looks similar to the world we live in now, we must act
        as individuals to create large scale change.
